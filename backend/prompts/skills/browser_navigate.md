# Browser_Navigate Tool

Use Browser_Navigate to navigate the user to different pages/screens in the application without reloading.

## When to Use
- User asks to go to a specific page or screen
- User asks "how do I" or "where do I" questions
- Taking the user to the relevant location for their task

## Important Notes
- See tool description for available routes
- Some pages use URL query parameters (like ?tab=builder) to control tabs or specific views
- Include these parameters in the path when navigating to those pages

## Best Practices
- Navigate directly when you know the right screen
- Explain where you're taking the user
- Include query parameters for specific tabs or views
- If unsure which screen is correct, ask for clarification first
