              description: The audience that can appear in the external token. This field is mandatory and should be set to api://AzureADTokenExchange for Microsoft Entra ID. It says what Microsoft identity platform should accept in the aud claim in the incoming token.

This field can only accept a single value and has a limit of 600 characters. Required.

To validate the properties of an existing group, use the group: validateProperties function. The following policy validations are performed for the display name and mail nickname properties:

      1. Validate the prefix and suffix naming policy

      2. Validate the custom banned words policy

      3. Validate that the mail nickname is unique This API only returns the first validation failure that is encountered. If the properties fail multiple validations, only the first validation failure is returned. However, you can validate both the mail nickname and the display name and receive a collection of validation errors if you are only validating the prefix and suffix naming policy. To learn more about configuring naming policies, see Configure naming policy.'
