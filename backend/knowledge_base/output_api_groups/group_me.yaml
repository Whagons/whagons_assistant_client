    summary: Get a user
    description: Retrieve the properties and relationships of user object. This operation returns by default only a subset of the more commonly used properties for each user. These default properties are noted in the Properties section. To get properties that are not returned by default, do a GET operation for the user and specify the properties in a $select OData query option. Because the user resource supports extensions, you can also use the GET operation to get custom properties and extension data in a user instance. Customers through Microsoft Entra ID for customers can also use this API operation to retrieve their details.

The service queries for the most recent activityHistoryItems, and then pull those related activities. Activities are sorted according to the most recent lastModified on the activityHistoryItem. This means that activities without activityHistoryItems won't be included in the response. The UserActivity.ReadWrite.CreatedByApp permission will also apply extra filtering to the response, so that only activities created by your application are returned. This server-side filtering might result in empty pages if the user is active and other applications have created more recent activities. To get your application's activities, use the nextLink property to paginate.

This can only be done by an administrator with appropriate permissions and can't be performed on a user's own account. To reset a user's password in Azure AD B2C, use the Update user API operation and update the passwordProfile > forceChangePasswordNextSignIn object. This flow writes the new password to Microsoft Entra ID and pushes it to on-premises Active Directory if configured using password writeback. The admin can either provide a new password or have the system generate one. The user is prompted to change their password on their next sign in. This reset is a long-running operation and returns a Location header with a link where the caller can periodically check for the status of the reset operation.

To attach a file that''s smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event. As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries. Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload.

To attach a file that''s smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event. As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries. Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload. The following are the steps to attach a file to an Outlook item using an upload session: See attach large files to Outlook messages or events for an example.'

    description: Get a set of event resources that have been added, deleted, or updated in a calendarView (a range of events defined by start and end dates) of the user's primary calendar. Typically, synchronizing events in a calendarView in a local store entails a round of multiple delta function calls. The initial call is a full synchronization, and every subsequent delta call in the same round gets the incremental changes (additions, deletions, or updates). This allows you to maintain and synchronize a local store of events in the specified calendarView, without having to fetch all the events of that calendar from the server every time.

    summary: Invoke function delta
    description: Get a set of event resources that have been added, deleted, or updated in a calendarView (a range of events defined by start and end dates) of the user's primary calendar. Typically, synchronizing events in a calendarView in a local store entails a round of multiple delta function calls. The initial call is a full synchronization, and every subsequent delta call in the same round gets the incremental changes (additions, deletions, or updates). This allows you to maintain and synchronize a local store of events in the specified calendarView, without having to fetch all the events of that calendar from the server every time.

    description: Get a set of event resources that have been added, deleted, or updated in a calendarView (a range of events defined by start and end dates) of the user's primary calendar. Typically, synchronizing events in a calendarView in a local store entails a round of multiple delta function calls. The initial call is a full synchronization, and every subsequent delta call in the same round gets the incremental changes (additions, deletions, or updates). This allows you to maintain and synchronize a local store of events in the specified calendarView, without having to fetch all the events of that calendar from the server every time.

    description: Get a set of event resources that have been added, deleted, or updated in a calendarView (a range of events defined by start and end dates) of the user's primary calendar. Typically, synchronizing events in a calendarView in a local store entails a round of multiple delta function calls. The initial call is a full synchronization, and every subsequent delta call in the same round gets the incremental changes (additions, deletions, or updates). This allows you to maintain and synchronize a local store of events in the specified calendarView, without having to fetch all the events of that calendar from the server every time.

Use this approach to attach a file if the file size is between 3 MB and 150 MB. To attach a file that''s smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event. As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries. Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload. The following are the steps to attach a file to an Outlook item using an upload session: See attach large files to Outlook messages or events for an example.'

To attach a file that''s smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event. As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries. Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload. The following are the steps to attach a file to an Outlook item using an upload session: See attach large files to Outlook messages or events for an example.'

    description: Get a set of event resources that have been added, deleted, or updated in a calendarView (a range of events defined by start and end dates) of the user's primary calendar. Typically, synchronizing events in a calendarView in a local store entails a round of multiple delta function calls. The initial call is a full synchronization, and every subsequent delta call in the same round gets the incremental changes (additions, deletions, or updates). This allows you to maintain and synchronize a local store of events in the specified calendarView, without having to fetch all the events of that calendar from the server every time.

    description: Get a set of event resources that have been added, deleted, or updated in a calendarView (a range of events defined by start and end dates) of the user's primary calendar. Typically, synchronizing events in a calendarView in a local store entails a round of multiple delta function calls. The initial call is a full synchronization, and every subsequent delta call in the same round gets the incremental changes (additions, deletions, or updates). This allows you to maintain and synchronize a local store of events in the specified calendarView, without having to fetch all the events of that calendar from the server every time.

Use this approach to attach a file if the file size is between 3 MB and 150 MB. To attach a file that''s smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event. As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries. Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload. The following are the steps to attach a file to an Outlook item using an upload session: See attach large files to Outlook messages or events for an example.'

Use this approach to attach a file if the file size is between 3 MB and 150 MB. To attach a file that''s smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event. As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries. Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload. The following are the steps to attach a file to an Outlook item using an upload session: See attach large files to Outlook messages or events for an example.'

    description: Get a set of event resources that have been added, deleted, or updated in a calendarView (a range of events defined by start and end dates) of the user's primary calendar. Typically, synchronizing events in a calendarView in a local store entails a round of multiple delta function calls. The initial call is a full synchronization, and every subsequent delta call in the same round gets the incremental changes (additions, deletions, or updates). This allows you to maintain and synchronize a local store of events in the specified calendarView, without having to fetch all the events of that calendar from the server every time.

    description: Get a set of event resources that have been added, deleted, or updated in a calendarView (a range of events defined by start and end dates) of the user's primary calendar. Typically, synchronizing events in a calendarView in a local store entails a round of multiple delta function calls. The initial call is a full synchronization, and every subsequent delta call in the same round gets the incremental changes (additions, deletions, or updates). This allows you to maintain and synchronize a local store of events in the specified calendarView, without having to fetch all the events of that calendar from the server every time.

Use this approach to attach a file if the file size is between 3 MB and 150 MB. To attach a file that''s smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event. As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries. Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload. The following are the steps to attach a file to an Outlook item using an upload session: See attach large files to Outlook messages or events for an example.'

To attach a file that''s smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event. As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries. Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload. The following are the steps to attach a file to an Outlook item using an upload session: See attach large files to Outlook messages or events for an example.'

    description: Get a set of event resources that have been added, deleted, or updated in a calendarView (a range of events defined by start and end dates) of the user's primary calendar. Typically, synchronizing events in a calendarView in a local store entails a round of multiple delta function calls. The initial call is a full synchronization, and every subsequent delta call in the same round gets the incremental changes (additions, deletions, or updates). This allows you to maintain and synchronize a local store of events in the specified calendarView, without having to fetch all the events of that calendar from the server every time.

To attach a file that''s smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event. As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries. Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload.

To attach a file that''s smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event. As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries. Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload. The following are the steps to attach a file to an Outlook item using an upload session: See attach large files to Outlook messages or events for an example.'

    description: Get a set of event resources that have been added, deleted, or updated in a calendarView (a range of events defined by start and end dates) of the user's primary calendar. Typically, synchronizing events in a calendarView in a local store entails a round of multiple delta function calls. The initial call is a full synchronization, and every subsequent delta call in the same round gets the incremental changes (additions, deletions, or updates). This allows you to maintain and synchronize a local store of events in the specified calendarView, without having to fetch all the events of that calendar from the server every time.

    description: Get a set of event resources that have been added, deleted, or updated in a calendarView (a range of events defined by start and end dates) of the user's primary calendar. Typically, synchronizing events in a calendarView in a local store entails a round of multiple delta function calls. The initial call is a full synchronization, and every subsequent delta call in the same round gets the incremental changes (additions, deletions, or updates). This allows you to maintain and synchronize a local store of events in the specified calendarView, without having to fetch all the events of that calendar from the server every time.

To attach a file that''s smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event. As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries. Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload.

To attach a file that''s smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event. As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries. Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload. The following are the steps to attach a file to an Outlook item using an upload session: See attach large files to Outlook messages or events for an example.'

    description: Get a set of event resources that have been added, deleted, or updated in a calendarView (a range of events defined by start and end dates) of the user's primary calendar. Typically, synchronizing events in a calendarView in a local store entails a round of multiple delta function calls. The initial call is a full synchronization, and every subsequent delta call in the same round gets the incremental changes (additions, deletions, or updates). This allows you to maintain and synchronize a local store of events in the specified calendarView, without having to fetch all the events of that calendar from the server every time.

    summary: Invoke function delta
    description: Get a set of event resources that have been added, deleted, or updated in a calendarView (a range of events defined by start and end dates) of the user's primary calendar. Typically, synchronizing events in a calendarView in a local store entails a round of multiple delta function calls. The initial call is a full synchronization, and every subsequent delta call in the same round gets the incremental changes (additions, deletions, or updates). This allows you to maintain and synchronize a local store of events in the specified calendarView, without having to fetch all the events of that calendar from the server every time.

By default, the allowNewTimeProposals property is set to true when an event is created, which means invitees can propose a different date/time for the event. See Propose new meeting times for more information on how to propose a time, and how to receive and accept a new time proposal. You can specify the time zone for each of the start and end times of the event as part of their values, because the

      start and end properties are of dateTimeTimeZone type. First find the supported time zones to make sure you set only time zones that have been configured for the user''s mailbox server. When an event is sent, the server sends invitations to all the attendees. Setting the location in an event An Exchange administrator can set up a mailbox and an email address for a resource such as a meeting room, or equipment

      like a projector. Users can then invite the resource as an attendee to a meeting. On behalf of the resource, the server accepts or rejects

      the meeting request based on the free/busy schedule of the resource.

      If the server accepts a meeting for the resource, it creates an event for the meeting in the resource''s calendar. If the meeting is rescheduled,

      the server automatically updates the event in the resource''s calendar. Another advantage of setting up a mailbox for a resource is to control scheduling of the resource, for example, only executives

      or their delegates can book a private meeting room. If you''re organizing an event that involves a meeting location: Additionally, if the meeting location has been set up as a resource, or if the event involves some equipment that has been set up as a resource:'

    description: Get a set of event resources that have been added, deleted, or updated in a calendarView (a range of events defined by start and end dates) of the user's primary calendar.

The initial call is a full synchronization, and every subsequent delta call in the same round gets the incremental changes (additions, deletions, or updates). This allows you to maintain and synchronize a local store of events in the specified calendarView, without having to fetch all the events of that calendar from the server every time.

The initial call is a full synchronization, and every subsequent delta call in the same round gets the incremental changes (additions, deletions, or updates). This allows you to maintain and synchronize a local store of events in the specified calendarView, without having to fetch all the events of that calendar from the server every time.

A channel without an owner or that belongs to a group that has no owner, can''t be archived. To restore a channel from its archived state, use the channel: unarchive method. A channel can’t be archived or unarchived if its team is archived.'

This action makes the collections of shift, openshift and timeOff items in the specified time range of the schedule viewable by the specified team members, including employees and managers. Each shift, openshift and timeOff instance in a schedule supports a draft version and a shared version of the item. The draft version is viewable by only managers, and the shared version is viewable by employees and managers. For each shift, openshift and timeOff instance in the specified time range, the share action updates the shared version from the draft version, so that in addition to managers, employees can also view the most current information about the item. The notifyTeam parameter further specifies which employees can view the item.

    summary: Get user mailbox settings
    description: 'Get the user''s mailboxSettings. You can view all mailbox settings, or get specific settings. Users can set the following settings for their mailboxes through an Outlook client: Users can set their preferred date and time formats using Outlook on the web. Users can choose one of the supported short date or short time formats. This GET operation returns the format the user has chosen. Users can set the time zone they prefer on any Outlook client, by choosing from the supported time zones that their administrator has set up for their mailbox server. The administrator can set up time zones in the Windows time zone format or  Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) time zone (also known as Olson time zone) format. The Windows format is the default. This GET operation returns the user''s preferred time zone in the format that the administrator has set up. If you want that time zone to be in a specific format (Windows or IANA), you can first update the preferred time zone
      in that format as a mailbox setting. Subsequently you will be able to get the time zone in that format. Alternatively, you can manage the format conversion separately in your app.'

To attach a file that''s smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event. As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries. Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload. The following are the steps to attach a file to an Outlook item using an upload session: See attach large files to Outlook messages or events for an example.'

To attach a file that''s smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event. As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries. Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload. The following are the steps to attach a file to an Outlook item using an upload session: See attach large files to Outlook messages or events for an example.'

Use this approach to attach a file if the file size is between 3 MB and 150 MB. To attach a file that''s smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event. As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries. Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload. The following are the steps to attach a file to an Outlook item using an upload session: See attach large files to Outlook messages or events for an example.'
