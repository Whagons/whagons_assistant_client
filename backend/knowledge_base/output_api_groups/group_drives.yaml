    description: "This function is the last in a series of steps to create a workbookTableRow resource asynchronously. A best practice to create multiple table rows is to batch them in one create tableRow operation and carry out the operation asynchronously. An asynchronous request to create table rows involves the following steps:\n1. Issue an async Create tableRow request and get the query URL returned in the Location response header.\n2. Use the query URL returned from step 1 to issue the Get workbookOperation request and get the operation ID for step 3. \n    Alternatively, for convenience, after you get a succeeded operationStatus result, you can get the query URL from the resourceLocation property of the workbookOperation returned in the response, and apply the query URL to step 3. \n3. Use the query URL returned from step 2 as the GET request URL for this function tableRowOperationResult. A successful function call returns the new table rows in a workbookTableRow resource. This function\
      \ does not do anything if called independently."

      Your app should continue calling with the @odata.nextLink until you see an @odata.deltaLink returned. After you received all the changes, you can apply them to your local state.

      To check for changes in the future, call delta again with the @odata.deltaLink from the previous response. The delta feed shows the latest state for each item, not each change. If an item was renamed twice, it only shows up once, with its latest name.

      The same item might appear more than once in a delta feed, for various reasons. You should use the last occurrence you see. Items with this property should be removed from your local state.'
