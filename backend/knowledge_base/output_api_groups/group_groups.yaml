To attach a file that''s smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event. As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries. Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload. The following are the steps to attach a file to an Outlook item using an upload session: See attach large files to Outlook messages or events for an example.'

Use this approach to attach a file if the file size is between 3 MB and 150 MB. To attach a file that''s smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event. As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries. Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload. The following are the steps to attach a file to an Outlook item using an upload session: See attach large files to Outlook messages or events for an example.'

    description: Get a set of event resources that have been added, deleted, or updated in a calendarView (a range of events defined by start and end dates) of the user's primary calendar. Typically, synchronizing events in a calendarView in a local store entails a round of multiple delta function calls. The initial call is a full synchronization, and every subsequent delta call in the same round gets the incremental changes (additions, deletions, or updates). This allows you to maintain and synchronize a local store of events in the specified calendarView, without having to fetch all the events of that calendar from the server every time.

    description: Get a set of event resources that have been added, deleted, or updated in a calendarView (a range of events defined by start and end dates) of the user's primary calendar. Typically, synchronizing events in a calendarView in a local store entails a round of multiple delta function calls. The initial call is a full synchronization, and every subsequent delta call in the same round gets the incremental changes (additions, deletions, or updates). This allows you to maintain and synchronize a local store of events in the specified calendarView, without having to fetch all the events of that calendar from the server every time.

Use this approach to attach a file if the file size is between 3 MB and 150 MB. To attach a file that''s smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event. As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries. Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload. The following are the steps to attach a file to an Outlook item using an upload session: See attach large files to Outlook messages or events for an example.'

Use this approach to attach a file if the file size is between 3 MB and 150 MB. To attach a file that''s smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event. As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries. Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload. The following are the steps to attach a file to an Outlook item using an upload session: See attach large files to Outlook messages or events for an example.'

Use this approach to attach a file if the file size is between 3 MB and 150 MB. To attach a file that''s smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event. As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries. Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload. The following are the steps to attach a file to an Outlook item using an upload session: See attach large files to Outlook messages or events for an example.'

To attach a file that''s smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event. As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries. Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload.

The initial call is a full synchronization, and every subsequent delta call in the same round gets the incremental changes (additions, deletions, or updates).

Use this approach to attach a file if the file size is between 3 MB and 150 MB. To attach a file that''s smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event. As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries. Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload. The following are the steps to attach a file to an Outlook item using an upload session: See attach large files to Outlook messages or events for an example.'

Use this approach to attach a file if the file size is between 3 MB and 150 MB. To attach a file that''s smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event. As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries. Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload. The following are the steps to attach a file to an Outlook item using an upload session: See attach large files to Outlook messages or events for an example.'

Use this approach to attach a file if the file size is between 3 MB and 150 MB. To attach a file that''s smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event. As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries. Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload. The following are the steps to attach a file to an Outlook item using an upload session: See attach large files to Outlook messages or events for an example.'

Use this approach to attach a file if the file size is between 3 MB and 150 MB. To attach a file that''s smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event. As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries. Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload. The following are the steps to attach a file to an Outlook item using an upload session: See attach large files to Outlook messages or events for an example.'

      Your app should continue calling with the @odata.nextLink until you see an @odata.deltaLink returned. After you received all the changes, you can apply them to your local state.

      To check for changes in the future, call delta again with the @odata.deltaLink from the previous response. The delta feed shows the latest state for each item, not each change. If an item was renamed twice, it only shows up once, with its latest name.

      The same item might appear more than once in a delta feed, for various reasons. You should use the last occurrence you see. Items with this property should be removed from your local state.'

      The application calls the API without specifying any parameters.

      The service begins enumerating sites and returns pages of changes to these sites, accompanied by either an @odata.nextLink or an @odata.deltaLink.

      Your application should continue making calls using the @odata.nextLink until there''s an @odata.deltaLink  in the response. After you receive all the changes, you can apply them to your local state.

      To monitor future changes, call the delta API by using the @odata.deltaLink in the previous response. Any resources marked as deleted should be removed from your local state.'

If the group was created less than 15 minutes ago, it''s possible for a call to create a team to fail with a 404 error code, due to ongoing replication delays.

      The recommended pattern is to retry the Create team call three times, with a 10 second delay between calls.'

The draft version is viewable by only managers, and the shared version is viewable by employees and managers. For each shift, openshift and timeOff instance in the specified time range, the share action updates the shared version from the draft version, so that in addition to managers, employees can also view the most current information about the item. The notifyTeam parameter further specifies which employees can view the item.

To attach a file that''s smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event. As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries. Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload. The following are the steps to attach a file to an Outlook item using an upload session: See attach large files to Outlook messages or events for an example.'

Use this approach to attach a file if the file size is between 3 MB and 150 MB. To attach a file that''s smaller than 3 MB, do a POST operation on the attachments navigation property of the Outlook item; see how to do this for a message or for an event. As part of the response, this action returns an upload URL that you can use in subsequent sequential PUT queries. Request headers for each PUT operation let you specify the exact range of bytes to be uploaded. This allows transfer to be resumed, in case the network connection is dropped during upload. The following are the steps to attach a file to an Outlook item using an upload session: See attach large files to Outlook messages or events for an example.'

    description: 'Validate that a Microsoft 365 group''s display name or mail nickname complies with naming policies.  Clients can use this API to determine whether a display name or mail nickname is valid before trying to create a Microsoft 365 group. To validate the properties of an existing group, use the group: validateProperties function. The following policy validations are performed for the display name and mail nickname properties:

      1. Validate the prefix and suffix naming policy

      2. Validate the custom banned words policy

      3. Validate that the mail nickname is unique This API only returns the first validation failure that is encountered. If the properties fail multiple validations, only the first validation failure is returned. However, you can validate both the mail nickname and the display name and receive a collection of validation errors if you are only validating the prefix and suffix naming policy. To learn more about configuring naming policies, see Configure naming policy.'
