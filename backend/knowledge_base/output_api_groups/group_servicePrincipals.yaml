              description: The audience that can appear in the external token. This field is mandatory and should be set to api://AzureADTokenExchange for Microsoft Entra ID. It says what Microsoft identity platform should accept in the aud claim in the incoming token. This value represents Microsoft Entra ID in your external identity provider and has no fixed value across identity providers - you might need to create a new application registration in your identity provider to serve as the audience of this token. This field can only accept a single value and has a limit of 600 characters. Required.

              type: string
              description: Required. The identifier of the external software workload within the external identity provider. Like the audience value, it has no fixed format; each identity provider uses their own - sometimes a GUID, sometimes a colon delimited identifier, sometimes arbitrary strings. The value here must match the sub claim within the token presented to Microsoft Entra ID. The combination of issuer and subject must be unique within the app. It has a limit of 600 characters. Supports $filter (eq).

To validate the properties of an existing group, use the group: validateProperties function. The following policy validations are performed for the display name and mail nickname properties:

      1. Validate the prefix and suffix naming policy

      2. Validate the custom banned words policy

      3. Validate that the mail nickname is unique This API only returns the first validation failure that is encountered. If the properties fail multiple validations, only the first validation failure is returned. However, you can validate both the mail nickname and the display name and receive a collection of validation errors if you are only validating the prefix and suffix naming policy. To learn more about configuring naming policies, see Configure naming policy.'
